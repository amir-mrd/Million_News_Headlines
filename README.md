Trends in News Headlines
What can the headlines from the Australian national broadcaster (the ABC) tell us about the concerns of the Australian public over time?
Using this dataset we want to know what are the most common words in the news headlines from 2003 until the end of 2021. These common words will be a measure of what are the main topics of newsheadlines reported by the largest news corporation in Australia. This, in turn, could be used to understand what Australians were most concerned about during this period.
